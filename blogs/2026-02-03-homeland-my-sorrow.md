We live in a time when the concept of Heimat is very important to many people. They look around in this ever-changing, ever-faster spinning world and reach for something solid so they won't be swept away by the waves of time. But in this case, does this term or understanding of Heimat not bring us more problems than it can solve? The suggestion that Heimat is something inherent, something innate to all people, seems more disastrous than helpful to me. Especially in a time when nothing remains standing for long or is allowed to remain standing, and is instead subjugated by the perpetual progress of the world.

When someone thinks of their Heimat, certain things may immediately come to mind. For some, it's the farm standing somewhere in the countryside, in a hidden valley, far from civilization. For some, it may also be a city where they grew up. But if one thinks a bit longer about the concept of Heimat, it quickly becomes obvious that it's not too easy to explain what Heimat actually is. Heimat can also be something totally abstract. For those who have been displaced, the concept of Heimat can simply be associated with people; it doesn't have to rely on any physical constructs.

For Adorno, in his work "Minima Moralia" written in exile, we see that Heimat requires the native language of the inhabitant in order to be any kind of Heimat at all. He writes: "Every intellectual in emigration, without exception, is damaged and does well to recognize it himself [...] He lives in an environment that must remain incomprehensible to him, [...] he is constantly lost. [...] His language is expropriated and the historical dimension from which he drew his strength is severed.[^1]" When he writes that his environment *must* remain incomprehensible to him, the question quite openly arises: why? I believe the answer lies in a section of Hegel's famous work "Phenomenology of Spirit," specifically in the fourth part of the book "The Truth of Self-Certainty." Hegel writes here: "Self-consciousness exists *in* and *for* itself when, and by the fact that, it so exists for another; that is, it exists only as something that is recognized.[^2]" We can also apply this principle to the culture of a people or tribe, since culture functions here as a kind of *supra-self-consciousness* of the people. By doing this, we see that it only exists insofar as it is foreign to another, an outsider. It *is* only as something recognized. If all the cultures of the world belonged to one giant amalgam, indistinguishable, then one could no longer recognize them at all, for there would be nothing here to recognize, only the whole itself. They need to exclude the outsiders in order to preserve their existence. At this point, I don't want to spend too much time on this topic, because we will return to it at a later point in the text.

Just over two years ago, I emigrated to a country that was almost completely, but not too foreign to me. I naturally left my country of origin at that time without any intention of ever returning long-term. At that time, however, I did not feel that the country I was leaving was a Heimat. Although I had spent my life there up to that point, I felt no emotional or spiritual connection. My family will certainly describe themselves as "countrymen" who belong to this country. However, we had no traditions of any kind. Life simply consisted of accepting the days that kept coming relentlessly (they still do, in fact). However, this didn't leave me lost and didn't force me to just drift aimlessly through the world, but it left me without any shackles or a particularly strong desire to remain permanently in that country. Instead, it gave me the longing to find somewhere where I feel "at home," what one could call a true "Heimat." I thought I had found this place, but with each new day that dawned, it slowly occurred to me: I had indeed found something different, insofar as I had the feeling of new freedom, but this feeling of belonging somewhere was still missing. I could choose new customs and traditions here, allow myself free rein to select what I really want, only participate as I please. I have also mastered the language to some extent. Fluent like my native language, it will probably never be, but to integrate myself sufficiently, it's quite enough. In the worst case, if both of these camouflage techniques were to fail, I would still have the excuse of the "foreigner," insofar as I could simply admit that I don't originally come from this country and therefore am not obligated to those customs, that I'm not even aware of them, a helpless fool who is condemned to wander unconsciously and lost through the world.

This is not only essential for my existence as a foreigner, but also for the existence of the native. He may indeed come from the country, know his way around here better than anyone else, but without the foreigner's admission that there is a certain culture here of which he himself knows nothing, whose rules he must follow, the existence of the native's identity would be endangered. He needs the foreigner, like the master needs the servant, without whom his position as master could not exist.[^3] Furthermore, that admission grants the foreigner an increase in perceived freedom. He must indeed forfeit his position in this power hierarchy, but by doing so, he is able to tear himself away from the shackles of native culture; for his mistakes there is always an excuse he can reach for. He can apologize for everything and nothing, as he deems necessary, and the possibility of choosing the new customs also means, of course, that he is bound to nothing, obligated to nothing. He is free from those cultural rules, in the truest sense of the word.[^4] In this freedom, however, lies simultaneously his lack of freedom. He may indeed learn all the rules, adopt all the customs and traditions, but these only apply insofar as they are accepted by the natives. The choice to consider himself here in this country as a true native remains outside his sphere of power. He and his entire existence are inevitably subject to the native of the country, and without running the risk of destroying his existence, the native cannot show him mercy. He must necessarily assert himself as master in this relationship. The only true freedom that remains for the foreigner in this relationship is the choice of veil with which he conceals his identity or *non-identity*. He is condemned to spend his days in this country as an outsider, without any hope of reconciliation. He can only hide and defend himself, hoping that he escapes undetected and can live out his life somewhat in peace.

These phenomena, however, do not apply to Heimat. As bleak as the situation may look here for the foreigner, the choice of his Heimat lies only with him and him alone. It cannot be dictated to him, no matter how hard one tries. The physical aspects of that Heimat could indeed be taken from him by means of force, but the metaphysical ones would continue to dwell within him. In this relationship between Heimat and inhabitant, there need not be another. It requires only the inhabitant and what he considers Heimat. This may consist of people, places, or even just a feeling that he carries within himself. Since Heimat dwells only within the person, it does not require the recognition of the other in order to exist. It doesn't have to be assimilated by another, but rather it succeeds in remaining free from the chains of the master. To this extent, it is possible for every person on earth to form a Heimat from what he deems right. He is not forced to bind himself to something that doesn't suit him, and he doesn't have to bow to anyone either.

Every person on earth therefore always has a hope for Heimat; the direction of all hope is solely Heimat; one must only allow oneself this hope. In a stanza of the poem "The Silesian Weavers" from 1844, Heinrich Heine wrote:

*A curse on the false fatherland,*  
*Where only shame and disgrace flourish,*  
*Where every flower is broken early,*  
*Where rot and decay delight the worm –*  
     *We weave, we weave![^5]*

One could interpret here that although the weavers do not feel in the right place in their "false fatherland," they nevertheless continue to weave, in the hope that they will manage to fabricate for themselves a new Heimat from the threads of their true being, that they can one day belong somewhere: a Heimat true to them. Ernst Bloch further wrote in his monumental work "The Principle of Hope":

*"Man still lives everywhere in prehistory, indeed everything and everyone still stands before the creation of the world, as a right one. The real genesis is not at the beginning, but at the end, and it only begins to begin when society and existence become radical, that is, grasp themselves at the root. The root of history, however, is the working, creating human being who transforms and overtakes the given circumstances. Once he has grasped himself and established what is his without externalization and alienation in real democracy, something arises in the world that shines into everyone's childhood and where no one has yet been: Heimat.[^6]"*

We see here that Heimat is not something that is latently inherent in humans. One must create it oneself. It cannot be imposed on a person. Moreover, a world in which humans are oppressed cannot offer them a Heimat. Heimat for Bloch here consists of memories of the past and simultaneously hope. The death of the *Urheimat*, which one perceives as true Heimat in one's childhood, presupposes the emergence of the true Heimat. Put differently: the death of the *Urheimat* conditions the birth of the new self-created one. But if a person is incapable of processing the loss of the *Urheimat*, he quickly falls into uncertain panic. He wants to hold on to the old *Urheimat*, not to walk through the world lonely and alone. Consequently, he tries to impose the identity of the *Urheimat* on himself, whether through nationalism or tribalism. A world that dwells only in his memory, he tries to revive in an endless battle that he can never win. He remains captive here, cannot free himself from the chains of this distorted impression of the past, and secretly feels ashamed that he is incapable of getting out of this bleak situation. He bounces back and forth against the walls of his self-created prison and is thereby only filled with feelings of shame and envy. He looks around and the people around him who are also on this journey seem to mock him. He can do nothing but reach for what seems to him the safest means to defend himself: the identity of the *Urheimat* that he has imposed on himself. It is the only thing in this world that is not foreign to him. It must now be imposed on others so that he can also force his feelings of shame and feelings of being lost onto them. They too must be as lost as he is, otherwise his place in the world is untenable and thus his existence as well.

We see from anti-Semites who believe that Jews have no right to a new Heimat because they have long been displaced, that this idea only brings hatred and violence with it. It cannot be dissolved. People who must flee from their own country, whether because of war or the climate crisis, find themselves without hope of a potential new Heimat because those who cling tightly to this fallible idea deny them the opportunity to settle and continue living in peace. They need the continued displacement of these people in order to be able to justify their own existence. Because they too feel displaced from their *Urheimat* and therefore consider themselves powerless, they are filled with envy. As Adorno and Horkheimer wrote in the later-added chapter of "Dialectic of Enlightenment": "*The thought of happiness without power is unbearable because it would be happiness at all.*"[^7] They want the sympathy that is given to the displaced. They want to seize that power which they believe others possess. Whoever can prove themselves here in this devastating discord as the powerless party is granted power,[^8] and since they erroneously hold fast to those outdated, puny rules of being native, they imagine that they must also prove themselves here as the master, that they are even capable of proving themselves as the master who, as before, needs the servant to maintain his firm position. To this extent, they must prove themselves simultaneously as victims and masters. They find themselves in a vicious circle that they can never break. They need power to preserve their position at the top of the power hierarchy, but cannot simply steal the supposed power of others without presenting themselves as powerless victims. They must sufficiently feign the suffering of the victim so that they can deceive others. They then exploit this perfidious pretense to assert themselves and oppress those people who have rid themselves of the dead *Urheimat*.

We frequently see this attitude represented among populist parties, which are currently achieving an enormous number of votes in Europe, for example. They speak of old times, of virtue, of Heimat and of old traditions that must be preserved. They appease this fetishization of the *Urheimat* that has spread. They try to alienate people who had to move, who have settled elsewhere, from their new Heimat. Among other things, they drag ideals, images, and clichés with them that are supposed to support their conception of the *Urheimat*. But they don't realize that what they are doing here can only disempower every attempt to revive the *Urheimat*. They create an image of a kind of land of milk and honey that is supposed to represent their true "Heimat," but in doing so they unknowingly rid themselves of the chance of a supposed return to this fabricated past, alienating themselves from their own Heimat with every step that drives them further into this disgraceful madness. The more complex their distorted image of the *Urheimat*, the more difficult the task becomes to return to it in the end.

They naturally know that if this delusion does not persist, it would terminally endanger their existence. They must propagate it in order to continue dividing people so that the foundation of their power does not crumble. If humans were to rid themselves of this fallible, trite concept of homeland, they could ultimately orient themselves forward and look the future in the eyes without being afraid of what is yet to come. The *Urheimat* need not necessarily be forgotten. However, we wave the club around paranoid in an attempt to defend our *Urheimat*, although it has long since died, and in doing so only strike ourselves. We merely need to overcome this in order to build a new, true Heimat. The direction of all hope is solely Heimat. It is not a place; it is rather a perspective, or a state in which one has freed oneself from all temporal, objective, and even spatial characteristics. It does not decay with the dissolution of borders or states, and although it may appear tremendously difficult, it is attainable for all people on earth.

I would like to conclude here with a poem by the poet Johannes R. Becher (from whom I also took the title of this text). I find it fitting to the text:

*Heimat, my sorrow,*  
 *Land in twilight's gleam,*  
 *Heaven, you my blue one,*  
 *You my cheerfulness.*

*One day it will be said:*  
 *When I was banished;*  
 *I have, to praise you,*  
 *Sent you a song.*

*Was, to unite you,*  
 *Dedicated a song to you,*  
 *And to weep with you*  
 *In the darkness…*

*Heaven seemed, a blue one,*  
 *Peace returned –*  
 *Heimat, my sorrow,*  
 *You, my cheerfulness.*
