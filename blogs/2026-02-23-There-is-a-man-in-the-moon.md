There is a man in the moon.

At around seven in the evening I got on.
I sat down.

There is a man in the moon.

I like to read, it doesn't bother me if someone watches me do it.
I would stay seated.

There is a man in the moon.

"Did you buy pancakes?"
"Of course!"

There is a man in the moon.

"It's still alright though."
"Indeed."

There is a man in the moon.

Time passes quickly,
when you let yourself get distracted.

There is a man in the moon.

Idleness is neither curse,
nor blessing.

There is a man in the moon.

The lights were off.
Now I have turned them on.

There is a man in the moon.

Twenty minutes ago I got off,
find myself in the countryside.

There is a man in the moon.

I didn't even say goodbye.
I didn't allow it.

There is a man in the moon.

Here you are after all.
What need for farewell.

There is a man in the moon.

This pounding.
This fear.

There is a man in the moon.

Here you wouldn't have felt it.
You wouldn't have had to be afraid.

There is a MAN in the moon.

Tenderly the flesh falls from the body.
You have given us this skin.

There is a MAN in the moon.

My breathing forms small clouds,
before my eyes.

There is a MAN in the moon.

The chance is gone,
there is no return for us.

There is a MAN in the MOON.

"Father, tear this damned skin from our bodies!"
Youth is already ruined.

THERE IS A MAN IN THE MOON.

It burns.
The blood congeals.

THERE IS A MAN IN THE MOON.

"Flog us, O you great others!"
"Have mercy on us NOT"

THERE IS A MAN IN THE MOON.

The bastard heart sits,
wedged in the chest.

THERE IS A MAN IN THE MOON.

"Let it turn to ashes"
"I implore you!"

THERE IS NO MAN IN THE MOON.

In vain.
