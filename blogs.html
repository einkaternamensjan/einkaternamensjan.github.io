We live in a time in which the concept of Heimat is very important to many people. They look around in this ever-changing, ever-faster-spinning world, and grasp for something solid, so that they are not swept away by the waves of time. But in this case, does this term or this understanding of Heimat not bring us more problems than it can solve? The suggestion that Heimat is something inherent, which dwells within all people, seems to me more fateful than helpful. Especially in a time in which nothing remains standing for long, or rather is allowed to remain standing, and is instead subjugated by the perpetual progress of the world.<br><br>When one thinks of one's Heimat, some things might immediately come to mind. For some it is the farmhouse that stands somewhere in the countryside, in a hidden valley, far from civilization. For some it might also be a city in which they grew up. But if one thinks a bit longer about the concept of Heimat, it quickly becomes apparent that it is not all that easy to explain what Heimat actually is. Heimat can also be something totally abstract. For those who have been displaced, the concept of Heimat can simply be associated with people; it does not have to be based on any physical constructs.<br><br>For Adorno, in his work "Minima Moralia", written in exile, we see that Heimat requires the mother tongue of the inhabitant in order to be any kind of Heimat at all. He writes: "<em>Every intellectual in emigration, without any exception, is damaged, and does well to recognize this himself [...] He lives in an environment that must remain incomprehensible to him, [...] he is constantly in error. [...] His language is expropriated and the historical dimension from which he drew his strength is cut off.[^1]</em>" When he writes that his environment <em>must</em> remain incomprehensible to him, the question arises quite openly: why? I believe the answer lies in a section of Hegel's famous work "Phenomenology of Spirit", namely in the fourth part of the book, "The Truth of Self-Certainty". Hegel writes here: "<em>Self-consciousness exists in and for itself when, and by the fact that, it so exists for another; that is, it exists only in being acknowledged.[^2]</em>" We can also apply this principle to the culture of a people or tribe, since culture here functions as a kind of <em>supra-self-consciousness</em> of the people. By doing this, we see that it only exists insofar as it is foreign to another, to an outsider. It <em>is</em> only as something acknowledged. If all the cultures of the world belonged to one giant amalgam, indistinguishable, then one could no longer acknowledge them at all, for there would be nothing here to acknowledge, only the whole itself. They need to exclude outsiders in order to preserve their existence. At this point, however, I do not want to spend too much time on this topic, because we will return to it at a later point in the text.<br><br>Just over two years ago I emigrated, to a country that was almost completely, but not entirely, foreign to me. At the time I naturally left my country of origin without the intention of ever returning for the long term. At the time, however, I did not feel that the country I was leaving was a Heimat. Although I had spent my life up to that point there, I felt no emotional or spiritual connection. My family would certainly describe themselves as "compatriots" who belong to this country. However, we had no traditions of any kind. Life simply consisted of enduring the days that came relentlessly onward (they still do, in fact). However, this did not leave me lost and did not force me to simply hurl aimlessly through the world, but it left me without any fetters or any particularly strong desire to remain permanently in that country. Instead, it gave me the longing to find somewhere where I feel "at ease", what one might call a true "Heimat". I thought I had found this place, but with each new day that dawned, it slowly occurred to me: I had indeed found something else, insofar as I had the feeling of new freedom, but this feeling of belonging somewhere was still missing. I could choose new customs and habits here, allow myself free rein to select what I really want, only participate as I please. I also have a reasonable command of the language. Fluent, like one's mother tongue, it will probably never be, but to integrate myself sufficiently, it is quite adequate. In the worst case, if both of these camouflage techniques were to fail, I would always still have the excuse of being a "foreigner", insofar as I could simply admit that I do not originally come from this country and therefore am not obligated to those customs, that I am not even aware of them, a helpless fool condemned to wander unconsciously and lost through the world.<br><br>This is essential not only for my existence as a foreigner, but also for the existence of the native. He may well come from the country, know his way around here better than anyone else, but without the foreigner's admission that there is a certain culture here, of which he himself can know nothing, to whose rules he must adhere, the existence of the native's identity would be endangered. He needs the foreigner, as the master needs the bondsman, without whom his position as master could not exist[^3]. Furthermore, that admission grants the foreigner an elevation in perceived freedom. Although he must forfeit his position in this power hierarchy, by doing this he manages to tear himself away from the shackles of the native's culture; for his mistakes there is always an excuse to which he can reach. He can apologize for everything and nothing, as he deems necessary, and the possibility of choosing the new customs naturally also means that he is bound to nothing, obligated to nothing. He is free from those cultural rules, in the truest sense of the word[^4]. In this freedom, however, lies at the same time his unfreedom. Although he may learn all the rules, appropriate all the customs and habits, these only apply insofar as they are accepted by the natives. The choice to consider himself here in this country as a true native remains outside his sphere of power. He and his entire existence are inevitably subject to the native of the land, and without running the risk of destroying his existence, the native can show him no mercy. He must necessarily assert himself as master in this relationship. The only true freedom that remains for the foreigner in this relationship is the choice of the veil with which he conceals his identity or <em>non-identity</em>. He is condemned to spend his days in this country as an outsider, without any hope of reconciliation. He can only hide and defend himself, in the hope that he escapes undetected and can live out his life somewhat in peace.<br><br>These phenomena, however, do not apply to Heimat. However bleak the situation may look here for the foreigner, the choice of his Heimat rests with him and him alone. It cannot be dictated to him, no matter how hard one tries. Although the physical aspects of that Heimat could be taken from him by means of force, the metaphysical ones would continue to dwell within him. In this relationship between Heimat and inhabitant there need be no other. It requires only the inhabitant and that which he considers Heimat. This may consist of people, places, or even just a feeling that he carries within himself. Since Heimat dwells only within the person, it does not require the acknowledgment of the other in order to be. It does not have to be assimilated by another, but instead succeeds in remaining free from the chains of the master. In this respect, it is possible for every person on earth to form a Heimat for themselves, from what they think is right. They are not forced to fetter themselves to something that does not suit them, and they do not have to bow before anyone either.<br><br>Every person on earth therefore always has a hope of Heimat; the direction of all hope is solely Heimat; one must only allow oneself this hope. In a stanza of the poem "The Silesian Weavers" from the year 1844, Heinrich Heine wrote:<br><br><em>A curse on the false fatherland,</em>  <br><em>Where only shame and disgrace flourish,</em>  <br><em>Where every flower is broken early,</em>  <br><em>Where putrefaction and decay delight the worm –</em>  <br>     <em>We weave, we weave![^5]</em><br><br>One could interpret here that although the weavers do not feel they are in the right place in their "false fatherland", they nevertheless weave on, in the hope that they may manage to fabricate a new Heimat for themselves from the fibers of their true being, that they can one day belong somewhere: a Heimat true to them. But who is really responsible for forging Heimat? To whom should this tremendously difficult task fall? If we assume, in the style of neoliberalism, the autonomy of all people and say that each person is only themselves responsible for the exhaustion of their Heimat, we see that it is impossible to create a single unique Heimat for each person that does not encroach upon the Heimat of another and thus can only lead to the tearing away of another's Heimat. Those conditions that are supposed to contribute to their true happiness, or at least give them the freedom to shape it as they wish, only lead into the bars of the prison from which they can never escape. They must be constantly vigilant, in the hope that no one comes to rob them of their Heimat. Since they must live here permanently in fear, we can deduce that they are not in any kind of Heimat. The person would then be cursed to live the rest of their life in misery, mourning the loss for which <em>they</em> alone bear the guilt. Only humanity as a whole can strive for Heimat. The weavers weave <em>together</em>, as a collective: "<em>We</em> weave". Heimat can therefore either be attainable for all people in the world or for no one. A person who steals Heimat from their kind can only thereby lose Heimat themselves. Adorno and Horkheimer wrote in their work "Dialectic of Enlightenment": "<em>of happiness without power, of reward without labor, of Heimat without boundary stone, of religion without myth.[^6]</em>" That is what all people on earth truly long for: Heimat. It can only be brought about when one frees it from those distinctions of objective, spatial existence; otherwise it is always doomed to failure. The only proof we need here to refute the myth that Heimat requires these objects is the fact that people who have never encountered these objects can also attain this state of Heimat, just like those who claim to need these objects. Their <em>presence</em> in the <em>absence</em> of these objects shows us that Heimat exists outside the realm of the objective; it overcomes it and transitions into an entirely metaphysical form. It is <em>in</em> and <em>for</em> itself. By its very nature, it is impossible to fetter its form in the merely physical. The alienation of Heimat that occurs when one attempts to locate it in mere objects is one of the greatest obstacles for humanity on its way to Heimat. Ernst Bloch further wrote in his monumental work "The Principle of Hope":<br><br><em>"Man still lives everywhere in prehistory; indeed everything and everyone still stands before the creation of the world, as a proper one. The real genesis is not at the beginning but at the end, and it only begins to begin when society and existence become radical, that is, grasp themselves at the root. The root of history, however, is the working, creating human being, who transforms and overtakes the given circumstances. Once he has grasped himself and established what is his without alienation and estrangement in real democracy, something arises in the world that shines into everyone's childhood and in which no one has yet been: Heimat.[^7]"</em><br><br>We see here that Heimat is not something that dwells latently within the person. One must create it oneself. It cannot be imposed upon the person. Moreover, a world in which the person is oppressed can offer them no Heimat. Heimat for Bloch here consists of memories of the past and at the same time hope. The death of the <em>Urheimat</em>, which one perceives in one's childhood as true Heimat, precedes the emergence of true Heimat. Put differently: the death of the <em>Urheimat</em> conditions the birth of the new, self-created one. But if the person is incapable of processing the loss of the <em>Urheimat</em>, they quickly fall into uncertain panic. They want to hold onto the old <em>Urheimat</em>, not to walk through the world alone and lonely. Consequently, they try to impose the identity of the <em>Urheimat</em> upon themselves, be it through nationalism or tribalism. A world that dwells solely in their memory, they try to revive, in an endless struggle that they can never win. They remain fettered here, cannot free themselves from the chains of this distorted impression of the past, and secretly feel ashamed that they are unable to escape this desolate situation. They bounce back and forth against the walls of their self-created prison and are thereby only filled with feelings of shame and envy. They look around and the people around them who are also on this journey seem to mock them. They can do nothing but reach for what seems to them the safest means to defend themselves: the identity of the <em>Urheimat</em> that they have imposed upon themselves. It is the only thing that is not foreign to them in this world. It must now be imposed on others, so that they can also force their feelings of shame and feelings of being lost upon them. They too must be as lost as they are, otherwise their place in the world is untenable and thus also their existence.<br><br>We see from anti-Semites, who believe that Judaism has no right to Heimat in the world, no matter in which country, because it has long since been displaced, that this idea only brings hatred and violence with it. To quote Adorno and Horkheimer again: "<em>instead of the voice of conscience it hears voices; instead of examining itself to take note of the protocol of its own lust for power, it attributes the Protocols of the Elders of Zion to others.[^8]</em>" This idea cannot be dissolved. People who must flee from their own country, whether because of war or the climate crisis, find themselves without any hope of a potential new Heimat, because those who cling firmly to this fragile idea deny them the ability to settle down and continue living in peace. They need the continued displacement of these people in order to be able to lay the foundation for their own existence. Because they also feel displaced from their <em>Urheimat</em> and therefore consider themselves powerless, they are filled with envy. As Adorno and Horkheimer wrote in the later added chapter of "Dialectic of Enlightenment": "<em>The thought of happiness without power is unbearable, because it would be happiness in the first place.</em>"[^9] They want the sympathy that one gives to the displaced. They want to seize that power which they believe to be in the possession of others. Whoever can prove themselves here in this devastating discord as the powerless party will be given the power[^10] and, since they erroneously cling to those outdated, feeble rules of being native, they imagine that they must also prove themselves here as the master, that they are even capable of proving themselves as the master, who still needs the bondsman in order to maintain his firm position. In this respect, they must prove themselves simultaneously as victim and master. They find themselves in a vicious circle that they can never break. Although they need power to preserve their place at the top of the power hierarchy, they cannot simply steal the supposed power of others without presenting themselves as powerless victims. They must sufficiently feign the suffering of the victim so that they can deceive the others. They then exploit this perfidious pretense to assert themselves and oppress those people who have rid themselves of the dead <em>Urheimat</em>.<br><br>We often see this attitude represented among the populist parties that, for example, are currently achieving an enormous number of votes in Europe. They speak of old times, of virtue, of Heimat and of old traditions that must be preserved. They appease this fetishization of the <em>Urheimat</em> that has spread. They try to alienate people who had to move, who have settled elsewhere, from their new Heimat. They drag along, among other things, ideals, images and clichés that are supposed to underpin their conception of the <em>Urheimat</em>. But they do not notice that what they are doing here can only disempower every attempt to revive the <em>Urheimat</em>. They create an image of a kind of land of plenty that is supposed to represent their true "Heimat", but in doing so they unwittingly rid themselves of the chance of a supposed return to this fabricated past, alienate themselves from their own Heimat with every step that drives them further into this disgraceful madness. The more complex their distorted image of the <em>Urheimat</em>, the more difficult the task of returning to it in the end becomes.<br><br>They naturally know in doing so that if this delusion does not persist, it would definitively endanger their existence. They must propagate it in order to continue to divide people, so that the foundation of their power does not crumble. If the person were to rid themselves of this fragile, trite concept of Heimat, they could ultimately face forward and look the future in the eye, without being afraid of what is yet to come. One does not necessarily have to forget the <em>Urheimat</em>. However, we wave the club around paranoid, in the attempt to defend our <em>Urheimat</em>, although it has long since died, and in doing so only hit ourselves. We merely have to overcome this in order to build a new, true Heimat. The direction of all hope is solely Heimat. It is not a place; it is rather a perspective, or a state in which one has freed oneself from all temporal, objective and even spatial characteristics. The feeling of security and at the same time adventure, like a child playing in the stream and knowing that its parents protect it from danger. It does not decay with the dissolution of borders or states and although it may seem tremendously difficult, it is attainable for all people on earth. Klaus Kufeld, the founding director of the Ernst Bloch Center, expressed it thus in his work "Heimat als Utopie": "<em>Perhaps it should be with Heimat as it is with hope. The hope that is always directed forward is not an affect for Ernst Bloch, not a pure feeling. For hope is only effective, sustainably effective, if it also withstands reality. Docta spes, the instructed, instructable hope, only becomes wise through disappointment. This hope is thought through the heart. Heimat alone as a backward-looking affect remains a diffuse feeling of Heimat, which so to speak gets stuck in the heart and sometimes gets caught there, crystallizes nostalgically. And nostalgic would mean: possibly losing the connection to reality. Politically exploited, but not ideologically captive,</em>  <br><em>it now becomes a fighting term again. Heimat as a category of thought oriented toward the future does not deny feeling at all, for the emotion remains wise.</em><br><br><em>Only then does Heimat become a practiced human right.[^11]</em>"<br><br>I would like to add a poem here at this point in conclusion by the poet Johannes R. Becher (from whom I also took the title of this text). I find it fitting to the text:<br><br><em>Heimat, my sorrow,</em>  <br> <em>Land in twilight's glow,</em>  <br> <em>Sky, you my blue one,</em>  <br> <em>You, my happiness.</em><br><br><em>One day it will say:</em>  <br> <em>When I was banished;</em>  <br> <em>Have I, to praise you,</em>  <br> <em>Sent you a song.</em><br><br><em>Was, to unite you,</em>  <br> <em>Consecrated you a song,</em>  <br> <em>And to weep with you</em>  <br> <em>In the darkness ...</em><br><br><em>Sky shone, a blue one,</em>  <br> <em>Peace returned –</em>  <br> <em>Heimat, my sorrow,</em>  <br> <em>You, my happiness.</em><br><br>[^1]: Theodor W.

<article id="post-2026-02-03-heimat-meiner-trauer">
Wir leben in einer Zeit, in der vielen Menschen das Konzept der Heimat sehr wichtig ist. Sie sehen sich in dieser immer wechselnden, sich immer schneller drehenden Welt um, und greifen nach etwas Festem, damit sie nicht von den Wellen der Zeit weggeschwemmt werden. Bringt uns aber in diesem Fall dieser Begriff oder dieses Verständnis der Heimat nicht mehr Probleme, als er lösen kann? Die Suggerierung, dass die Heimat etwas Inhärentes sei, was allen Menschen innewohnt, kommt mir eher verhängnisvoll als hilfreich vor. Vor allem in einer Zeit, in der nichts lange stehen bleibt bzw. stehen bleiben darf und stattdessen von dem fortwährenden Fortschritt der Welt unterjocht wird. <br><br>Wenn einer an seine Heimat denkt, mögen ihm sofort einige Sachen einfallen. Für manche ist es der Bauernhof, der irgendwo auf dem Land steht, in einem versteckten Tal, der Zivilisation fern. Für manche mag es auch eine Stadt sein, in der sie groß geworden sind. Wenn man aber ein bisschen länger über den Begriff der Heimat nachdenkt, wird es schnell sinnfällig, dass es nicht allzu einfach ist zu erklären, was Heimat eigentlich ist. Die Heimat kann auch etwas total abstraktes sein. Für die, die vertrieben worden sind, kann der Begriff der Heimat schlichtweg mit Menschen assoziiert werden, er muss sich nicht auf irgendwelche physischen Konstrukten stützen.  <br>Für Adorno, in seinem im Exil geschriebenen Werk “Minima Moralia”, sehen wir, dass die Heimat der Muttersprache des Einwohners bedarf, um überhaupt eine Art Heimat zu sein. Er schreibt “<em>Jeder Intellektuelle in der Emigration, ohne alle Ausnahme ist beschädigt, und tut gut daran, es selber zu erkennen \[...\] Er lebt in einer Umwelt, der ihm unverständlich bleiben muß, \[...\] immerzu ist er in der Irre. \[...\] Enteignet ist seine Sprache und abgegraben die geschichtliche Dimension, aus der er seine Kräfte zog.[^1]”</em>. Als er schreibt, dass seine Umwelt ihm unverständlich bleiben <em>muss</em>, stellt sich ganz offen die Frage warum? Ich glaube, die Antwort liegt in einem Abschnitt von Hegels berühmten Werk "Phänomenologie des Geistes”, und zwar in dem vierten Teil des Buches “die Wahrheit der Gewissheit seiner selbst”. Hegel schreibt hier: <em>"Das Selbstbewusstsein ist an und für sich, indem, und dadurch, dass es für ein Anderes an und für sich ist; d.h. es ist nur als ein Anerkanntes.[^2]”</em>. Wir können dieses Prinzip auch auf die Kultur eines Volkes oder Stammes anwenden, da die Kultur hier als eine Art <em>Supra-Selbstbewusstsein</em> des Volkes fungiert. Indem wir dies machen, sehen wir, dass sie nur existiert, insofern, dass sie für einen Anderen, einen Außenseiter, fremd ist. Es <em>ist</em> nur als ein Anerkanntes. Wenn alle Kulturen der Welt einem riesigen Amalgam gehören würden, undifferenzierbar, dann könnte man sie gar nicht mehr anerkennen, denn es gäbe hier nichts, was anzuerkennen wäre, nur das Ganze an sich. Sie benötigen es, die Außenseiter auszuschließen, um ihre Existenz zu bewahren. An dieser Stelle möchte ich aber nicht zu viel Zeit auf dieses Thema verwenden, denn wir werden es zu einem späteren Zeitpunkt in dem Text wieder aufgreifen.<br><br>Vor knapp über zwei Jahren bin ich ausgewandert, in ein mir fast komplett, aber nicht allzu fremdes Land. Ich habe damals natürlich mein Herkunftsland verlassen, ohne die Absicht, je langfristig zurückzukehren. Ich empfand damals allerdings das Land, das ich verließ, nicht als eine Heimat. Zwar habe ich mein bisheriges Leben dort verbracht, aber eine emotionale oder spirituelle Verbindung fühlte ich nicht. Meine Familie wird sich ganz bestimmt als "Landsleute" bezeichnen, die in dieses Land gehören. Traditionen jeglicher Art hatten wir jedoch nicht. Das Leben bestand schlichtweg aus dem Hinnehmen der Tage, die unaufhörlich weiter kamen (dies tun sie nämlich immer noch). Dies ließ mich allerdings nicht verloren und zwang mich auch nicht, einfach ziellos durch die Welt zu schleudern, aber es ließ mich ohne jegliche Fesseln oder eine besonders starke Lust, in jenem Land permanent zu verweilen. Es erbrachte mir stattdessen die Sehnsucht, irgendwo zu finden, wo ich mich “wohl” fühle, das, was man als eine wahre “Heimat” bezeichnen könnte. Ich dachte, ich hätte diesen Ort gefunden, aber mit jedem neuen Tag, der neu anbrach, fiel es mir langsam ein: Ich hatte zwar etwas anderes gefunden, insofern ich das Gefühl von neuer Freiheit hatte, aber dieses Gefühl von irgendwohin Gehören fehlte mir doch weiterhin. Ich konnte mir hier neue Bräuche und Sitten auswählen, mir freien Lauf erlauben, um das zu selektieren, was ich wirklich haben möchte, nur mitmachen, wie es mir gefällt. Die Sprache beherrsche ich auch einigermaßen. Fließend, wie die Muttersprache, wird sie womöglich nie sein, aber um mich hinreichend zu integrieren, reicht es durchaus aus. Schlimmstenfalls, wenn beide von diesen Tarntechniken scheitern würden, hätte ich immer noch die Ausrede des “Ausländers”, insofern ich einfach zugeben könnte, dass ich nicht ursprünglich aus diesem Land stamme und ich daher nicht zu jenen Sitten verpflichtet bin, dass ich mir derer gar nicht bewusst sei, ein hilfloser Narr, der ganz unbewusst verloren durch die Welt zu gehen bestraft ist.   <br>Dies ist nicht nur wesentlich für mein Dasein als Fremder, sondern auch für das Dasein des Einheimischen. Er mag zwar aus dem Land stammen, sich hier so gut auskennen, wie niemand anderes, aber ohne das Eingeständnis des Fremden, dass es hier eine gewisse Kultur gebe, wovon er selbst nichts wissen könne, an deren Regeln er sich halten müsse, würde die Existenz der Identität des Einheimischen gefährdet. Er bedarf des Fremden, wie der Herr des Knechts, ohne welchen es seine Position als Herr nicht geben könnte[^3]. Ferner verleiht jenes Eingeständnis dem Fremden eine Erhöhung an empfundene Freiheit. Er muss zwar seine Position in dieser Machthierarchie einbüßen, aber indem er dies tut, vermag er es, sich von den Manschetten des Einheimischen Kultur zu entreißen; für seine Fehler gibt es immer eine Ausrede, nach der er greifen kann. Er kann sich für alles und nichts entschuldigen, wie er es für nötig hält, und die Möglichkeit, die ihm neuen Sitten auszuwählen, heißt natürlich auch, dass er an nichts gebunden ist, zu nichts verpflichtet ist. Er ist von jenen kulturellen Regeln frei, im wahrsten Sinne des Wortes[^4]. In dieser Freiheit indes besteht zugleich seine Unfreiheit. Er mag zwar alle Regeln lernen, sich alle Bräuche und Sitten aneignen, aber diese gelten nur insofern sie von den Einheimischen akzeptiert werden. Die Wahl zu treffen, sich hier in diesem Land als wahrer Einheimischer zu betrachten, bleibt außerhalb seines Machtbereiches. Er und sein ganzes Dasein sind unweigerlich dem Eingeborenen des Landes unterworfen und ohne Gefahr zu laufen, seine Existenz zu zerstören, kann ihm der Eingeborene kein Erbarmen zeigen. Er muss sich zwangsläufig als Herr in dieser Beziehung durchsetzen. Die einzige wahre Freiheit, die dem Fremden in dieser Beziehung übrig bleibt, ist die Wahl des Schleiers, womit er seine Identität oder <em>Unidentität</em>, verdeckt. Er ist verdammt, seine Tage in diesem Land als Außenseiter zu verbringen, ohne jegliche Hoffnung auf Versöhnung. Er kann sich nur verstecken und wehren, in der Hoffnung, dass er unentdeckt auskommt und sein Leben einigermaßen in Ruhe ausleben kann.<br><br>Diese Phänomene gelten hingegen nicht für die Heimat. Wie düster die Lage hier für den Fremden aussehen mag, die Wahl seiner Heimat obliegt nur ihm und ihm alleine. Die kann ihm nicht diktiert werden, egal wie sehr man sich bemüht. Die physischen Aspekte jener Heimat könnte man ihm zwar vermittels der Gewalt entziehen, aber die metaphysischen würden ihm weiterhin innewohnen. In dieser Beziehung zwischen Heimat und Einwohner braucht es keinen anderen zu geben. Es bedarf nur des Einwohners und dessen, was er als Heimat betrachtet. Dies mag aus Menschen, Orten, oder gar nur einem Gefühl, das er in sich trägt, bestehen. Da die Heimat nur innerhalb des Menschen wohnt, bedarf sie nicht der Anerkennung des Anderen, um zu sein. Sie muss nicht von einem Anderen assimiliert werden, sondern ihr gelingt es, frei von den Ketten des Herrn zu bleiben. Insofern ist es für jeden Menschen auf der Erde möglich, sich eine Heimat zu bilden, aus dem, was er für richtig hält. Er ist nicht gezwungen sich an etwas zu fesseln, was ihm nicht passt, und er muss sich auch vor niemandem beugen.   <br>Jeder Mensch der Erde hat demnach immer eine Hoffnung auf Heimat, die Zielrichtung aller Hoffnung ist einzig die Heimat; man muss sich nur diese Hoffnung erlauben. In einer Strofe des Gedichts “Die schlesischen Weber” aus dem Jahr 1844 schrieb Heinrich Heine:<br><br><em>Ein Fluch dem falschen Vaterlande,</em>  <br><em>Wo nur gedeihen Schmach und Schande,</em>  <br><em>Wo jede Blume früh geknickt,</em>  <br><em>Wo Fäulniß und Moder den Wurm erquickt –</em>  <br>     <em>Wir weben, wir weben\![^5]</em> <br><br>Man könnte hier deuten, dass obgleich die Weber sich in ihrem “falschen Vaterland” nicht am richtigen Platz fühlen, weben sie trotzdem weiter, in der Hoffnung, dass sie es vermögen, sich eine neue Heimat, aus den Fasen ihres wahren Seins, zu fabrizieren, dass sie eines Tages irgendwohin gehören können: eine ihnen wahre Heimat. Wer ist aber wirklich zuständig für das Schmieden der Heimat? Wem soll diese ungeheuer schwere Aufgabe obliegen? Nehmen wir im Stil des Neoliberalismus die Eigenständigkeit aller Menschen an und sagen wir das jeder Mensch nur selbst für die Erschöpfung seiner Heimat verantwortlich ist, sehen wir, dass es unmöglich ist, eine einzelne einzigartige Heimat für jeden Menschen zu schaffen, die nicht in die Heimat eines anderen übergreift und insofern nur zu dem Entreißen der Heimat des anderen führen kann. Jene Bedingungen, die zu seinem wahren Glück beitragen sollen, oder zumindest ihm die Freiheit geben, um das so zu gestalten, wie er es möchte, münden nur in die Gitter des Zuchthauses, aus dem er es nie heraus vermag. Er muss ständig wachsam sein, in der Hoffnung, dass niemand kommt, um ihn der Heimat zu berauben. Da er hier permanent in Angst leben muss, können wir ableiten, dass er sich in keiner Art von Heimat befindet. Der Mensch sei dann verflucht, den Rest seines Lebens in Misere zu leben, um den Verlust, wofür <em>er</em> lediglich die Schuld trage, zu betrauern. Einzig die Menschheit als Ganzes kann die Heimat anstreben. Die Weber weben <em>zusammen</em>, als ein Kollektiv: “<em>Wir</em> weben”. Die Heimat kann demnach entweder für alle Menschen der Welt oder Niemanden erreichbar sein. Ein Mensch, der seinesgleichen die Heimat entwendet, kann nur dabei selbst die Heimat verlieren. Adorno und Horkheimer schrieben in ihrem Werk "Dialektik der Aufklärung": <em>"des Glückes ohne Macht, des Lohnes ohne Arbeit, der Heimat ohne Grenzstein, der Religion ohne Mythos.[^6]</em>" Das sei es, was alle Menschen der Erde wirklich ersehnen: die Heimat. Sie kann erst nur zustande gebracht werden, wenn man sie von jenen Distinktionen der gegenständlichen, räumlichen Existenz befreit, sonst ist sie immer zum Scheitern verurteilt. Der einzige Beweis, den wir hier brauchen, um den Mythos, dass die Heimat dieser Gegenstände bedarf, zu widerlegen, ist die Tatsache, dass Menschen, die diesen Gegenständen nie begegnet sind, diesen Zustand der Heimat ebenso erreichen können, wie diejenigen, die behaupten, diese Objekte zu benötigen. Ihre <em>An</em>wesenheit in der <em>Ab</em>wesenheit dieser Objekte zeigt uns, dass die Heimat außerhalb des Reiches des Gegenständlichen existiert, sie überwindet es und geht in eine gänzlich metaphysische Form über. Sie ist <em>an</em> und <em>für</em> sich. Ihrem Wesen nach ist es unmöglich, ihre Form in dem bloßen Physikalischen zu fesseln. Die Entäußerung der Heimat, die vonstatten geht, wenn man versucht, sie in bloßen Gegenständen zu verorten, ist eines der größten Hindernisse für die Menschheit, auf ihrem Weg in die Heimat. Ernst Bloch schrieb ferner in seinem monströsen Werk “Das Prinzip Hoffnung”:<br><br><em>"Der Mensch lebt noch überall in der Vorgeschichte, ja alles und jedes steht noch vor Erschaffung der Welt, als einer rechten. Die wirkliche Genesis ist nicht am Anfang, sondern am Ende, und sie beginnt erst anzufangen, wenn Gesellschaft und Dasein radikal werden, das heißt sich an der Wurzel fassen. Die Wurzel der Geschichte aber ist der arbeitende, schaffende, die Gegebenheiten umbildende und überholende Mensch. Hat er sich erfaßt und das Seine ohne Entäußerung und Entfremdung in realer Demokratie begründet, so entsteht in der Welt etwas, das allen in die Kindheit scheint und worin noch niemand war: Heimat.[^7]"-</em><br><br>Wir sehen hier, dass die Heimat nicht etwas ist, was dem Menschen latent innewohnt. Man muss sie selbst schaffen. Sie kann dem Menschen nicht auferlegt werden. Darüber hinaus kann eine Welt, in der der Mensch unterdrückt wird, ihm keine Heimat bieten. Die Heimat für Bloch hier besteht aus Erinnerungen der Vergangenheit und zugleich Hoffnung. Der Tod der <em>Urheimat</em>, welche man in seiner Kindheit als wahre Heimat empfindet, setzt der Entstehung der wahren Heimat voraus. Anders ausgedrückt: bedingt der Tod der <em>Urheimat</em> die Geburt der neuen selbst geschaffenen. Ist der Mensch aber unfähig, den Verlust der <em>Urheimat</em> zu verarbeiten, so gerät er schnell in ungewisse Panik. Er will sich an der alten <em>Urheimat</em> festhalten, durch die Welt nicht einsam und allein gehen. Demzufolge versucht er, sich die Identität der <em>Urheimat</em> aufzuzwingen, sei es durch Nationalismus oder Tribalismus. Eine Welt, die einzig ihm in Erinnerung wohnt, versucht er wiederzubeleben, in einem endlosen Kampf, der für ihn nie zu gewinnen ist. Er bleibt hier gebändigt, kann sich von den Ketten dieses verzogenen Eindrucks der Vergangenheit nicht befreien und schämt sich heimlich dafür, dass er außerstande ist, aus dieser öden Lage rauszukommen. Er prallt hin und her, auf die Wände seines von ihm selbst geschaffenen Gefängnisses und wird dabei nur von Gefühlen der Schande und des Neids gefüllt. Er sieht sich um und die Menschen um ihn herum, die sich auch auf dieser Reise befinden, scheinen ihn zu verhöhnen. Er kann nichts anderes als nach dem ihm scheinbar sichersten Mittel greifen, um sich zu wehren: die Identität der <em>Urheimat</em>, die er sich auferlegt hat. Sie ist das einzige, was ihm in dieser Welt nicht fremd ist. Sie muss jetzt den anderen oktroyiert werden, damit er seine Schamgefühle und Gefühle der Verlorenheit auch auf sie zwingen kann. Sie müssen auch so verloren sein wie er, sonst ist sein Platz in der Welt unhaltbar und damit auch sein Dasein.   <br>Wir sehen von Antisemiten, die glauben, dass das Judentum der Welt kein Recht auf Heimat, egal in welchem Land, hat, weil es schon längst verdrängt worden ist, dass diese Idee nur Hass und Gewalt mit sich bringt. Um wieder Adorno und Horkheimer zu zitieren <em>“anstatt der Stimme des Gewissens hört es Stimmen; anstatt in sich zu gehen, um das Protokoll der eigenen Machtgier aufzunehmen, schreibt es die Protokolle der Weisen von Zion den andern zu.[^8]”</em>. Diese Idee lässt sich nicht auflösen. Menschen, die aus ihrem eigenen Land flüchten müssen, sei es wegen Krieg oder der Klimakrise, befinden sich gar ohne Hoffnung auf eine potenzielle neue Heimat, weil diejenigen, die sich fest an dieser hinfälligen Idee krallen, es ihnen versagen, sich niederzulassen und in Ruhe weiterzuleben. Sie brauchen die fortwährende Vertreibung dieser Menschen, um das eigene Dasein zugrunde legen zu können. Weil sie sich auch von ihrer <em>Urheimat</em> vertrieben fühlen und daher sich als machtlos betrachten, erfüllt sie der Neid. Wie Adorno und Horkheimer in dem später hinzugefügten Kapitel von “Dialektik der Aufklärung” schrieben: "<em>Der Gedanke an Glück ohne Macht ist unerträglich, weil es überhaupt erst Glück wäre.</em>”[^9]. Sie wollen die Sympathie, die man den Verdrängten schenkt. Sie wollen jene Macht ergreifen, die sie glauben, im Besitz der anderen zu sein. Wer sich hier in dieser verheerenden Zwietracht als die machtlose Partei beweisen kann, dem wird die Macht geschenkt[^10] und, da sie sich fehlerhaft an jenen überholten, schmächtigen Regeln des Einheimischseins festhalten, wähnen sie, dass sie sich auch hier als der Herr erweisen müssen, dass sie es gar vermögen, sich als der Herr zu erweisen, der nach wie vor des Knechtes bedarf, um seine feste Position zu behalten. Insofern müssen sie sich parallel als Opfer und Herr beweisen. Sie befinden sich in einem Teufelskreis, den sie nie zerschlagen können. Sie brauchen zwar die Macht, um ihre Stelle an der Spitze der Machthierarchie zu bewahren, können die vermeintliche Macht der anderen aber nicht einfach entwenden, ohne sich als machtlose Opfer zu geben. Sie müssen das Leid des Opfers hinreichend vormachen, damit sie die anderen täuschen können. Diese perfide Vortäuschung nutzen sie dann aus, um sich durchzusetzen und jene Menschen, die sich der toten <em>Urheimat</em> entledigt haben, zu unterdrücken.  <br>Wir sehen diese Haltung häufig unter den populistischen Parteien vertreten, die beispielsweise in Europa gerade eine ungeheure Menge an Stimmen erzielen. Sie sprechen von alten Zeiten, von Tugend, von Heimat und von alten Traditionen, die man zu bewahren habe. Sie beschwichtigen diese Fetischisierung der <em>Urheimat</em>, die sich ausgebreitet hat. Sie versuchen die Menschen, die umziehen mussten, sich woanders niedergelassen haben, ihrer neuen Heimat zu entfremden. Sie schleppen unter anderem Ideale, Bilder und Klischees mit sich, die ihre Vorstellung der <em>Urheimat</em> untermauern sollen. Sie merken aber nicht, dass das, was sie hier tun, nur jeden Versuch auf Wiederbelebung der <em>Urheimat</em> entmachten kann. Sie kreieren ein Bild von einer Art Schlaraffenland, das ihre wahre “Heimat” repräsentieren soll, aber dabei entledigen sie sich unwissentlich der Chance einer vermeintlichen Rückkehr in diese fabrizierte Vergangenheit, entfremden sich der eigenen Heimat mit jedem Schritt, der sie weiter in diesen schmählichen Wahnsinn treibt. Je komplexer ihr verzogenes Bild von der <em>Urheimat</em>, desto schwieriger wird die Aufgabe, am Ende in sie zurückzukehren.   <br>Sie wissen selbstverständlich dabei, dass, wenn diese Wahnvorstellung nicht beharrt, es ihre Existenz endgültig gefährden würde. Sie müssen sie propagieren, um die Menschen weiterhin zu entzweien, damit das Fundament ihrer Macht nicht zerfällt. Würde der Mensch sich dieses hinfälligen, abgedroschenen Begriffes der Heimat entledigen, könnte er sich letztendlich nach vorne richten und der Zukunft in die Augen schauen, ohne dabei Angst zu haben, vor dem, was noch kommt. Die <em>Urheimat</em> muss man nicht zwangsläufig vergessen. Wir fuchteln jedoch paranoid mit der Keule herum, in dem Versuch, unsere <em>Urheimat</em> zu verteidigen, obwohl sie schon längst verstorben ist, und treffen dabei nur uns selbst. Dies müssen wir bloß überwinden, um eine neue, wahre Heimat aufzubauen. Die Richtung aller Hoffnung ist einzig die Heimat. Sie ist kein Ort, sie ist vielmehr eine Perspektive, oder ein Zustand, in dem man sich von allen zeitlichen, gegenständlichen und gar räumlichen Merkmalen befreit hat. Das Gefühl von Geborgenheit und zugleich Abenteuer, wie ein Kind, das im Bach spielt und dabei weiß, dass seine Eltern ihn vor Gefahr hüten. Sie verfällt nicht mit der Auflösung von Grenzen oder Staaten und obwohl es ungeheuer schwierig erscheinen mag, ist sie für alle Menschen der Erde erreichbar. Klaus Kufeld, der Gründungsdirektor des Ernst-Bloch-Zentrums, drückte es in seinem Werk “Heimat als Utopie” so aus: <em>“Vielleicht sollte es sich mit der Heimat verhalten wie mit der Hoffnung. Die stets nach vorn gerichtete Hoffnung ist bei Ernst Bloch kein Affekt, kein reines Gefühl. Denn Hoffnung sei nur wirksam, nachhaltig wirksam, wenn sie auch der Wirklichkeit standhalte. Docta spes, die belehrte, belehrbare Hoffnung werde erst aus Enttäuschung klug. Diese Hoffnung wird durch das Herz gedacht. Heimat allein als rückwärtsgewandter Affekt bleibt ein diffuses Heimatgefühl, das sozusagen im Herzen hängenbleibt und manchmal sich dort verfängt, nostalgisch kristallisiert. Und nostalgisch hieße: womöglich den Wirklichkeitsbezug zu verlieren. Politisch ausgeschlachtet, nicht aber ideologisch befangen,</em>  <br><em>wird sie nun doch wieder zum Kampfbegriff. Heimat als der Zukunft zugewandte Kategorie des Denkens verleugnet das Gefühl keineswegs, denn die Emotion bleibt klug.</em><br><br><em>Erst dann wird Heimat zu einem praktizierten Menschenrecht.[^11]”.</em><br><br>Ich möchte hier an dieser Stelle zum Schluss ein Gedicht von dem Dichter Johannes R. Becher ( von dem ich mir auch den Titel dieses Textes genommen habe.) hinzufügen. Ich finde es passend zu dem Text:<br><br><em>Heimat, meine Trauer,</em>  <br> <em>Land im Dämmerschein,</em>  <br> <em>Himmel, du mein blauer,</em>  <br> <em>Du mein Fröhlichsein.</em><br><br><em>Einmal wird es heißen:</em>  <br> <em>Als ich war verbannt;</em>  <br> <em>Hab ich, dich zu preisen,</em>  <br> <em>Dir ein Lied gesandt.</em><br><br><em>War, um dich zu einen,</em>  <br> <em>Dir ein Lied geweiht,</em>  <br> <em>Und mit Dir zu weinen</em>  <br> <em>In der Dunkelheit …</em><br><br><em>Himmel schien, ein blauer,</em>  <br> <em>Friede kehrte ein –</em>  <br> <em>Heimat, meine Trauer,</em>  <br> <em>Du, mein Fröhlichsein.</em><br><br>[^1]:  Theodor W.

<article id="post-2025-11-02-kultur-kapitalismus">
Die Frage, die ich hiermit stelle und dabei versuchen will, eine Antwort zu geben, lautet so:  „Befinden wir uns in einer Zeit, in der die Kultur blüht wie nie zuvor? Oder befinden wir uns in jener Zeit, in der ein erzwungener Aufschwung der Produktion der Kulturgüter durch den Kapitalismus unsere Fähigkeiten, das zu verstehen, was wir gerade konsumieren, verdirbt?“ Was die Implikationen letzteres sind, versuche ich mit diesem Beitrag darzulegen. Ich werde mich derzeit vorliegend mit diesem Phänomen in Bezug auf die moderne Situation der Literatur beschäftigen. Ich hoffe aber, ein paar Bezugspunkte der kulturellen Entwicklung der letzten Jahre anknüpfen zu können, um dies in einem größeren Rahmen verständlich zu machen.<br><br>Ich hatte vor, einfach mit den Tatsachen anzufangen. Ich habe aber später beim Schreiben des Texts gemerkt, ohne eine Erklärung der Grundlagen meiner Ansichten, kommt man nicht allzu weit mit den vorliegenden Tatsachen. Ich fange demzufolge an, mit dem Subjekt, das zu diesem Gedanken geführt hat. Und zwar, was genau für eine Rolle spielt das Denken und das Überlegen in dem Leben eines Menschen und innerhalb der Gesellschaft?   <br>Die Griechen dachten, dass der Mensch existiere, um des Denkens willen. Es gebe nichts edleres als das Denken selbst. Was genau ein Mensch zu einem Menschen macht, sei das Denken gewesen. Tiere können das bloß nicht. Ein Tier habe es nicht nötig zu denken, es sei durch sein Leben einfach zur Aktion aufgefordert, und ohne zu denken springe es hinein. Was einen Mensch ausmache, ist diese einzigartige Fähigkeit zum Denken. Diese Idee mag stimmen, jedoch ist sie nicht vollständig. Es folgt nämlich dem Denken das Überlegen. Ein ganz wichtiger Punkt, der hier von den Griechen nicht beachtet wurde. Was ein Mensch von einem Tier unterscheidet, ist die Fähigkeit, sich in sich selbst hineinziehen zu können, sich die Welt um sich herum zu betrachten, und sich zu überlegen, wie er damit umgehen soll. Das ist der Zweck des Überlegens[^1]. Ein Tier befindet sich in einer ständigen Situation der Aktion. Wenn ein Tier sich in aller Ruhe befindet, dann, und nur dann, schläft es ein. Menschen, andererseits, haben diese geniale Fähigkeit. Sie können sich in sich hinein zurückziehen und da bleiben, bis sie fertig sind und ihre Entscheidungen getroffen haben. Natürlich gibt es Situationen, wo das nicht immer möglich ist, wo man weniger Zeit hat als günstig ist, aber im Vergleich zu dem Tier, welches das nicht vermag, ist dies eine sehr vorteilhafte Eigenschaft. <br><br>Was uns auch hier wichtig ist, ist die Sprache. Diese Fähigkeit zu überlegen, wäre ohne die Sprache nicht mal halb so komplex. Hannah Arendt sprach von einem „Dialog der Einsamkeit“, der in jedem Menschen stattfinde und aus dem „das Gewissen für das eigene Handeln und Sprechen erwachse“[^2]. Ein Mensch kann nichts anderes sein, als das, was er ausdrücken kann. Man kann sich natürlich ohne die Sprache ausdrücken, aber nur bis zu einem gewissen Punkt. Die Sprache ist dem Überlegen wesentlich, insofern sie das Verstehen oder gar die Schöpfung neuer Ideen ermöglicht. Jener von Arendt erwähnte Dialog der Einsamkeit kann nicht vonstatten gehen, wenn der Mensch die Sprache nicht beherrscht, welche die Fähigkeit zum Überlegen erheblich einschränkt und dies wiederum die Fähigkeit zum Handeln einschränkt. Ein Mensch könnte es schaffen, sein ganzes Leben, ohne sich ausdrücken zu müssen, zu überleben. Er kann sich alles, was er bedarf, verschaffen. Er kann Getreide ernten, sein Vieh schlachten und sich ein Haus bauen, ohne sich einmal in seinem Leben ausgedrückt zu haben. Befindet er sich indes in einer Gesellschaft, dann ist es  wirklich von Vorteil, jene sprachlichen Fähigkeiten zu entwickeln. Indem er dies tut, erhebt er sich aus dem Stadium des <em>Animal Laborans</em>, in dem er nur ein arbeitendes Wesen ist, und in das Stadium des <em>Homo Agens</em>. Er besitzt plötzlich die Fähigkeit, mit seinen Mitmenschen zu kommunizieren, er kann plötzlich Gegenstände schaffen und gar tauschen, gegen Währung oder Ware, um sich besser versorgen zu können. Dies ist aber nicht das letzte Stadium, in das er einziehen kann. Es gibt nämlich noch das Stadium des <em>Homo Agens</em>. Dies besteht aus der Fähigkeit zu handeln. Das Leben des <em>Homo Agens</em> bestehe, laut Arendt, aus der Tätigkeit, die direkt zwischen den Menschen ohne die Vermittlung von materiellen Dingen stattfindet[^3]. In diesem Stadium befindet sich jegliches politisches Handeln, aber nicht nur das, sondern auch jegliches Handeln zwischen mehreren Menschen. Wichtig hier zu bemerken ist, dass für Arendt alles, was im öffentlichen Raum zwischen Menschen und nicht nur dem reinen Überleben oder deren privater Sphäre dient, politisch war[^4], ich schreibe es nur so, als gäbe es diesen Unterschied, um es verständlicher zu machen. Dieses Stadium spielt in dem vorliegenden Text eine wesentliche Rolle. In diesem Stadium ereignen sich nämlich jene gesellschaftlichen Phänomene, für die wir uns hier interessieren. All dies bedeutet, dass dieses letzte Stadium der Sprache, also der Fähigkeit, miteinander kommunizieren zu können, bedarf. Sie ist dann, insofern, unentbehrlich, wenn man weiteren gesellschaftlichen Fortschritt anstrebt.   <br>Diese zwei Fähigkeiten, die wir besprochen haben, stützen sich, ihrem Wesen nach, aufeinander. Mit der Entartung einer der beiden Fähigkeiten, würde sich die andere schlicht rückgängig entwickeln. Diese beiden Ideen der Sprache und des Überlegens sind uns sehr wichtig. Ohne diese Grundlage fällt es uns erheblich schwerer, die folgenden Tatsachen zu verstehen.   <br>   <br>Ich fange mit dem an, was ich als Genese des modernen Teils dieses Phänomens empfinde. Und zwar seitdem man „Indie“, ungefähr in den 90er Jahren, als ein eigenes Genre der Musik eingeführt hat, hat dies zu einer Beseitigung der individuell produzierten Musik geführt. Die Musik, die von Individuellen produziert wurde, gehörte nicht mehr dazu, es wurde ausgemerzt und ersetzt durch massenproduzierte Lieder, die von den größten Mächten der Industrie betrieben wurden. Indie hieß nicht mehr individuell, es vertrat nur den Schein eines Individuellen, eines freien Künstlers, der sich von jenen großen Record Labels nicht beeinflussen lässt, das Antlitz eines unaufrichtigen Rebellen. Man könnte hier zwar ferner in die Vergangenheit blicken, um einen umfangreichen Überblick zu schaffen. Doch um den Stand der Dinge verständlich zu machen, ist dies nicht unbedingt nötig. Wir beschäftigen uns hier hauptsächlich mit den zeitgenössischen Tatsachen. Dasselbe Phänomen lässt sich in den 70-80er Jahren beobachten. Man hatte die Punk-Bewegung nicht verstehen können, oder gar früher in den 50-60er Jahren die neue Jazz-Bewegung, und die Musikindustrie hatte sich gefährdet gefühlt, von dem, was sie nicht kontrollieren konnten. Dies drohte mit einer Umstülpung des Systems, hätten sie ungeregelt weitermachen können. Und wichtig in einer kapitalistischen Gesellschaft ist nämlich, das, was man nicht kontrollieren kann, kann man nicht zum eigenen Gebrauch nutzen. Ohne dieses Verständnis, kann die Möglichkeit, davon zu profitieren, nicht entstehen. Das sehen wir aber nicht nur in der Musikindustrie, das ist in allen Branchen der Kultur-Industrie zu beobachten. Man führt was Neues und Bahnbrechendes auf die Bühne auf, es folgt großer Aufruhr, und was passiert infolgedessen? Entweder es verschwindet komplett von der Landkarte der Kunst, und bleibt nur noch in Obskurität zu finden, wie etwa in der höheren Gesellschaft, wo Geld gerne ausgegeben wird, um solch erhabene Dinge zu haben. Anstatt den Tiger niederzuschießen, lockt man ihn in eine Falle, befördert ihn in die Tiefen einer Höhle und stellt ihn nur den eingeweihten Gästen zur Schau. Hier, unter dieser kompletten Kontrolle, kann er sie nicht mehr gefährden und was passiert wenn er sich eines Tages entscheidet, nicht mehr mitzumachen?   <br>Dann wird er  eingeschläfert, ausgemerzt, um nur als dunkle Erinnerung auszuharren. Im Gegensatz dazu gibt es eine zweite Möglichkeit. Es wird  reproduziert, hundertmal, tausendmal, zehntausendmal. Wie eine Flut verbreitet es sich rasend durch das Land, alle reden davon, alle können nicht genug davon bekommen. Die Leute stürzen sich wie Geier darauf. Aber all dies kann nur passieren, wenn man sich die Lizenzen des Werks besorgt und es zulässt, dass es überall aufgeführt wird. Aber natürlich nicht, wie es erst am Anfang gespielt wurde, nein. Man muss die Ecken abschneiden, alles, was schwer zu verstehen ist, abschleifen, bis ein glitzernder polierter Diamant der Massenmedien daraus entsteht. Dies bedeutet allerdings nicht, dass durch diesen Vorgang das Werk alle Eigenschaften der Kritik verliert. Es darf noch diesen kritischen Schein behalten. Entbehrt ein Werk jeglicher Aspekten der Gesellschaftskritik, erfüllt es nur die Rolle der perfidesten Propaganda, indem es nur dazu dient, die Gehirne der Massen zu stumpfen, alle Gedanken des Widerstands zu beseitigen, gar eine Ablenkung davon zu beschaffen.   <br>Dies ist ein Phänomen eigentümlich einer kapitalistischen Gesellschaft. Wenn man nicht imstande ist, etwas zu verstehen, wie soll es überhaupt einen Zweck haben? Der Zweck, der der Gesellschaft hier wichtig ist, ist nämlich nichts anderes als die Fähigkeit, profitabel zu sein. Ein Gegenstand, mit dem man kein Geld verdienen kann, ist im Rahmen einer kapitalistischen Gesellschaft sinnlos. Es existiert, aber mehr nicht. Wie Marx in seinem Werk “Das Kapital” geschrieben hat; “Endlich kann kein Ding Wert sein, ohne Gebrauchsgegenstand zu sein. Ist es nutzlos, so ist auch die in ihm enthaltene Arbeit nutzlos, zählt nicht als Arbeit und bildet daher keinen Wert”[^5]. Daher haben Record Label Executives jene trotzigen Künstler:innen kaufen lassen, um den eigenen Einfluss ausüben zu können, und damit die Kunst dieser Musik endlich verständlich und “wertvoll” zu machen. Die Krallen und Zähne des Tigers wurden abgerissen und ihm wurde freier Lauf zugebilligt.  <br>Das ist in der Literaturbranche nicht anders als in der Musikindustrie, wenn man bedenkt, dass die meisten Verlage alle von verschiedenen Großkonzernen gekauft worden sind[^6]. Angesichts dieser Tatsachen fühle man sich dann wohl berechtigt, wenn man sich die Frage stellt „gibt es dann überhaupt eine organische Vielfältigkeit in der modernen Literaturindustrie?“. Die Antwort darauf ist zum Glück noch ja. Es gibt immer noch die kleineren eigenständigen Verlage, die ihr Sortiment noch frei gestalten können. Natürlich spüren sie aber den Druck der Großverlage, die den Markt schwer beeinflussen können, indem sie ungeheure Menge an Bücher produzieren und verkaufen können, wohingegen die kleineren Verlage gezwungen sind, den Takt der Riesen zu halten, indem sie eine Auswahl an Büchern, die man an ein nicht allzu spezialisiertes Publikum verkaufen kann, produzieren müssen. Das ist auf die meisten Verlage des Deutschen Buchhandels anzuwenden.[^7]<br><br>Was das alles dann für die Leute, die diese Literatur verbrauchen, heißt, ist folgendes. Die Bücher, die auf den Markt kommen, sind nicht mehr da, um die Kultur selbst zu fördern, sie sind da, um den Menschen den zerstörenden Verbrauch der Kultur zu erleichtern. Wir führen hier ein Beispiel aus dem allgemeinen Einzelhandel ein, nämlich Geschenkartikel. Man sieht seit Jahren in allen Branchen des Einzelhandels den stetigen Anstieg der Zahl der Geschenkartikel, die auf den Markt kommen. Sie tauchen in allen Formen auf, sind nicht mehr zu entkommen. Egal welchen Laden man betritt, egal zu welcher Jahreszeit, man wird stets von diesen Sachen konfrontiert. Man behauptet, sie seien da, um die Entscheidung des Einkaufs zu erleichtern. Das sei ihr Hauptziel. Im Gespräch mit dem trügerischen Verkäufer hört man, wie einfach das Schenken geworden sei, dabei weiß er aber, es ging bei solchen Artikeln nie um das Schenken selbst. Hier geht es um einst, und zwar den beschleunigten Verbrauch von Waren. Solche Gegenstände brauchen wenig Zeit zu produzieren, sie sind kostengünstig, von geringer Qualität und die schieren Massen, in denen diese Dinge herstellbar sind, lassen sich wie eine Seuche durch das Land verbreiten. Gleichwohl ist uns hier einst noch wichtig, nämlich der Entscheidungsprozess. Der ungeheure Verbrauch von jenen Gegenständen wäre überhaupt nicht möglich, ohne eine Verkürzung des Entscheidungsprozesses. Je schneller man einen Laden betreten, sich etwas beschaffen und nachher den Laden verlassen kann, desto besser ist das für den Verbrauch solcher Ware und daher die Hersteller. Dies ermöglicht es den Herstellern dieser Artikel, immer wachsende Mengen an diesen Waren zu verkaufen, und dabei fordern sie nur eine weitere Verkürzung des Entscheidungsprozesses auf. Dies werde dann den Massen von Kund:innen unterschwellig aufoktroyiert, indem sie nur diese vermeintliche Erleichterung des Schenkens sehen, nicht aber das Erblicken des ganzen Systems vermögen. Dies ist nicht nur ein bloßes Beispiel, sondern es versinnbildlicht genau jenen Punkt, den ich hier hervorheben will. <br><br>Wir ziehen im Folgenden die Literaturindustrie in Betracht. Der normale Vorgang des Schreibens ist zu lang für den typischen Verlag. Um noch profitabler zu sein, müssen die Autor:innen, auf Kosten des Talents, immer schneller schreiben, um ihr Werk produzieren zu können. Je schneller man schreiben kann, umso besser für den Verlag und die Autor:innen, die wiederum nur ausgewählt werden können, wenn sie diese Ziele treffen. Das heißt, das, was für einen Verlag Spitzenliteratur ausmacht, besteht darin, dass man es schnell lesen,  schnell verbrauchen kann und auch schnell wieder Neues kaufen kann. Es besteht nicht mehr darin, dass das Werk vom überlegenen Niveau ist. Ausgezeichnet wird nur die Fähigkeit eines Werkes, Gewinn zu erzielen und danach entsorgt zu werden. <br><br>Es gibt ein interessantes Charakteristikum, das ausschließlich dem Buch bzw. der Literatur eigentümlich ist. Und zwar, dass das Lesen, seinem Wesen nach, die Auseinandersetzung des Lesers mit dessen Thema fordert. Es benötigt insofern ein aktives Engagement. Man kann keinen Text bloß anfassen und dessen Inhalt absorbieren. Als Leser:in muss man sich aktiv damit auseinandersetzen, um den Inhalt annehmen zu können. Dieses Charakteristikum des Lesens spielt für uns hier in zweifacher Weise eine wichtige Rolle. Erstens, man maßt dem Lesen an, aus eben diesem Grund immer etwas Positives zu sein, dadurch, dass der Leser immer aufgefordert wird, sich mit irgendeinem Thema beschäftigen zu müssen. Egal, was dieses Thema sei. Als man die Buchpreisbindung in Großbritannien einführen wollte, wurde die Aussage “Books are different\!” (Bücher sind anders) von dem englischen Richter Buchley getroffen, weil er genau dieser Meinung war.   <br>Deswegen interessiert es uns hier der zweite Punkt, nämlich, weil Bücher anders sind, haben sie einen Status der Unanfechtbarkeit gewonnen. Sie wenden sich willkürlich von jeglicher versuchten Kritik ab, ohne diese zur Kenntnis zu nehmen, weil sie sonst Gefahr laufen, von der Spitze des vermeintlichen Elfenbeinturms hinabzustürzen. <br><br>Das Problem mit dieser Abneigung, Bücher zu kritisieren, ist folgendes. Genau weil Bücher diese intensive Auseinandersetzung mit einem Thema fordern, kann ein Mangel an Inhalten, welche diese Entwicklung des kritischen Denkens verlangen, zum Verlernen des Überlegens führen. Man muss nur die verschiedenen sozialen Medien anschauen, um zu sehen, dass man sich bei manchen Inhalten im Prinzip mit nichts auseinandersetzt. Hier kommt dem Gehirn nichts zugute, es wird bloß stimuliert, aber mehr nicht. Die immer weitere Verbreitung der Desinformationen durch solche Plattformen ist ein perfektes Beispiel dafür. Dieser bloße Schein der Beschäftigung mit einer Sache ist genau das, was die Industrie missbraucht, um jene perfide Lüge weiter zu verbreiten, dass man sich etwas gutes antue, indem man sich einfach immer mehr Bücher zulegt und verbraucht. Weil sie ja "anders" sind, sind sie demzufolge immer eine Bereicherung für den Käufer. Dies kann aber nicht stimmen. Man muss sich doch kalkuliert durch diese Welt der Bücher bewegen. Kauft man immer die gleichen Bücher, immer dasselbe Genre, schafft man keine Berührungspunkte zu neuen Themen oder noch wichtiger zu neuen Wörtern. Man befindet sich in einem Teufelskreis, aus dem es keinen Ausgang gibt. Die Sprachfähigkeiten werden durch einen selbst beschränkt und so auch die Fähigkeit zum Handeln.<br><br>In letzter Zeit ist die Abhängigkeit von dem Verbrauch der Kultur gestiegen. Wer nicht mitmacht, laufe Gefahr, etwas zu verpassen, nicht mehr mit der Gesellschaft verbunden bleiben zu können, sich als Idiot zu enttarnen. Das wird nämlich den Menschen auferlegt von einer spätkapitalistischen Gesellschaft, einer Gesellschaft, die sich nur um den blinden Konsum dreht und sich nicht mehr um das Überlegen kümmert. Wer nicht konsumiert, ist ein Außenseiter und da man Angst vor dem was man nicht versteht hat, muss er verdrängt werden. Er kann für die Gesellschaft nur ein Risiko darstellen.   <br>Man betrachtet sich heutzutage selbst sogar als Anhänger eines Verlags, nicht nur der Autor:innen, deren Werk man gerne liest. Das wird begründet mit dem typischen Spruch „es gäbe das alles nicht ohne die Verlage\!“. Die Kultur und die Literatur gab es stets vor der riesigen Ausbeuterei der großen Verlage, nicht als Folge dessen, sondern andersherum. Die Verlage haben nämlich den Autor:innen zu verdanken, dass sie überhaupt existieren. Die Rolle des großen Verlags ist nicht mehr die des Kulturverbreiters, sondern die des Ausbeuters. Diese willkürliche Unterstützung kann den Verlagen nur zugutekommen. Sie müssen sich nicht mehr zögern, einen neuen Titel zu verlegen. Sie wissen, dass er, egal  <br>wie gut er inhaltlich ist, von den hungernden Mäulen der stumpfen Massen, die vehement nach mehr kreischen, aufgefressen wird. Sie müssen nicht mehr erwägen, ob es sich lohnt, den Titel zu veröffentlichen, was den Vorgang des Veröffentlichens noch weiter beschleunigt.   <br>Das führt zu einer weiteren Ausmerzung des Überlegens. Wenn man sich das Überlegen verschont und sich nur mit dem Verbrauch beschäftigen kann, rutscht man in jene Falle der Industrie, die die Gesellschaft aus diesem Teufelskreis des weiteren Verbrauchs nicht entkommen lässt. Man muss nicht nachdenken, um weiter zu kaufen. Und diese Verhinderung des Überlegens, produziert durch die Gier der großen Verlage, mit ihrem unendlichen Werben und beständigen Produzieren, ist gewollt. Man hätte lieber Kund:innen, die in einem Zustand der Unfähigkeit zu überlegen sind, als Kund:innen, die sich alles überlegen, ehe sie etwas kaufen. Wenn man die Massen überwältigen kann, indem man ungeheure Mengen an Büchern produziert und überall für die neuesten Titel Werbung macht, bleiben sie dann unfähig zu erkennen, was mit ihnen wirklich passiert. <br><br>Dasselbe Verfahren lässt sich auch in den Kinos beobachten. Der neueste Film ist nur so gut, bis die Produktionsfirma ihr Geld hat und dann, wie bestellt, kommt sofort der nächste, ohne eine Pause dazwischen, währenddessen man sich merken vermag, was man überhaupt gesehen hat. Greifen wir hier auch wieder auf die vorher erwähnte Tatsache, die wir in der Musikindustrie gesehen haben, nämlich dass alles, was sich rebellisch gibt, in so einem System beseitigt werden muss. Im Fall des Kinos bleibt dies noch stichhaltig. Indem man auf keine schwere Kritik stoßen kann, verliert man das Gefühl für das, was schwere Kritik überhaupt ist. Indem man mit der Sprache der Rebellion nicht mehr in Kontakt kommt, verlernt man die Fähigkeit, sie zu verstehen. Man kann nur Herr eines Systems bleiben, wenn die anderen der Fähigkeit Widerstand zu leisten entbehren.   <br>Diese Fähigkeit zum Widerstehen ist hier eng mit der Fähigkeit der Sprache verbunden, insofern, dass die Sprache eine wesentliche Rolle in der Funktion des Handelns spielt. Wer der richtigen Sprache entbehrt, entbehrt auch aller Möglichkeiten des Handelns. Es laufen immer noch die typischen Filme, die sich der Gesellschaft zuwenden und versuchen, der Gesellschaft einen Spiegel vorzuhalten. Diese sorgen dann natürlich für Aufruhr, indem jene Leute, die die Kritik nicht mehr gewohnt sind, sich beleidigt fühlen, weil es ihnen schwer fällt sie zu verstehen. Dies führt aber keinen gesellschaftlichen Wandel herbei, denn genau diejenigen, die den Spiegel vorhalten, verstecken sich hinter jenem Spiegel. Sie sehen sich nicht an, vor lauter Angst, ihr eigenes Antlitz zu erblicken, falls es sie in Stein verwandelt. Über die Themen jener Filme  lässt sich streiten, aber genau darum kommt es zu keinem Wandel, aufgrund dieser gesellschaftlichen Zwietracht, herbeigerufen mit Absicht von den großen Studios. Solange man die Fähigkeit zum Handeln der Menschen nach und nach abschafft und die Menschen mit kümmerlichen Keilereien entzweit, bleibt man ohne große Mühe deren Herr.<br><br>Darüber was dann die genauen Folgen hier sein könnten, lässt sich spekulieren. Man konzentriert sich nur auf den Konsum, beschäftigt sich nicht mehr mit dem Überlegen, aber die Welt dreht sich trotzdem weiter. Man muss doch noch politische Entscheidungen treffen, die sich auf die ganze Gesellschaft, wenn nicht die Welt, auswirken. Ich wage es zu sagen, dass dieser Fokus auf den Konsum auf die vorher erwähnte Art und Weise, die Fähigkeit des Menschen, solche Entscheidungen zu treffen, eingeschränkt hat. In einer Gesellschaft, an der man nur teilnehmen könne, wenn man mit dem gigantischen Konsum Takt halten kann, kann man sich nämlich nicht mehr in sich hineinziehen, um die Welt in Ruhe zu betrachten, um sich das zu überlegen, was man heute erlebt hat und was man morgen machen soll. Wenn man von allen Seiten angegriffen wird, von einer Gesellschaft, die Anwesenheit in jedem Moment fordert, um den Takt des Konsums zu halten oder gar zu beschleunigen, gibt es diese Möglichkeiten mehr oder minder nicht mehr. Der Hammer schlägt immer wieder. Man wird von der Welt ständig zur Aktion aufgefordert, aber ohne die wesentliche Zeit, dies zu überlegen, läuft man kopfüber in eine rasche Entscheidung hinein. Dies liegt, wie man aus den letzten zwei Jahrhunderten erkennen kann, dem Totalitarismus und dem Faschismus zugrunde. <br><br>Ich nähre mich hiermit langsam meinen Rückschluss an.   <br>Man sieht heutzutage wie die Großkonzernen der USA dem amerikanischen Präsident schmeicheln, um sich seine Gnade zu sichern. Die Gnade eines Mannes, der eine faschistische Regierung in einem der mächtigsten Länder der Welt führt. “Der Faschismus ist nicht mehr das Gespenst an der Wand, mit dem die einfältigen erschreckt werden, sondern er ist zur furchtbaren Wirklichkeit geworden, bricht mit seinen Armeen tief in das Land ein, brandschatzend, mordend, alles verwüstend.” \- Robert Havemann in seinem Buch “Fragen, Antworten, Fragen.”. Die Frage, die sich seit dem Anfang Trumps zweiter Amtszeit gestellt hat, ist jene, auf die wir immer noch keine richtige Antwort haben. Wie kann es einem nur so leicht fallen, Faschist:innen zu wählen?  Ich glaube eine fundamentale Säule dessen Erfolg, und des Erfolgs derer, die in Europa auch an den Wahlen immer mehr an Wähler:innen gewinnen, besteht darin, dass diese erzwungene Produktion der Kultur im Namen des Kapitals, dieser „Kultur-Kapitalismus“, dazu geführt hat, die Menschen so zu beschäftigen, dass sie sich lieber einer totalen Herrschaft opfern, die alles für sie übernimmt und bewältigt, als sich von diesem unendlichen Kreis des Konsums zu befreien und diese Kraft des Überlegens, die eigentümlich des Menschen ist, in Gang setzen, um die um sich herum liegende Welt zu betrachten und jene demokratischen Entscheidungen zu fällen, die nur eine ganze Gesellschaft zusammen fällen kann. Dies mag jenen Menschen als die leichtere Option scheinen. Wenn man die Sprache der Eliten nicht verstehen vermag, wie soll man damit überhaupt handeln? Das spielt direkt in die Hände der Faschisten, die dies wissen und deren Pläne darauf aufbauen. Wir können uns aber mittels der Literatur helfen, unsere Position in der Gesellschaft zu erheben. Sie ist immer noch da und steht uns immer noch zur Verfügung. Man muss sich bloß der Propaganda der Kulturindustrie entziehen . Dies mag keine leichte Aufgabe sein, aber als Bürger einer demokratischen Gesellschaft ist man zum Mitmachen verpflichtet, eine Gesellschaft mag nur fortschreiten, sofern die eigenen Mitglieder selbst Fortschritt schaffen. Die Demokratie ist ein lebendes unendliches Projekt, ohne diese Zeit des Überlegens kann sie aber nicht mehr funktionieren, den Kopf nicht über Wasser halten. Sie würde schlichtweg der Entbehrung des Überlegens erliegen. Jene Zeit ist erforderlich, sie wird von der Demokratie gebraucht, wie ein Mensch die Luft zum Atmen braucht. In einem System des unendlichen Verbrauchs und Wiederproduzierens verschwinden langsam diese Pausen zum Atmen. <br><br>[^1]:  Jose Ortega Y Gasset, Der Mensch und die Leute, Kapitel 2<br><br>[^2]:  Vanessa Schmitz, Das Verhältnis von Sprache und Miteinandersein, <a href='https://www.hannaharendt.net/index.php/han/article/download/495/758/1241'>https://www.hannaharendt.net/index.php/han/article/download/495/758/1241</a><br><br>[^3]:  Hannah Arendt, Vita Activa oder vom Tätigen Leben, Piper Verlag München,dritte Auflage, 2023, Kapitel Fünf <br><br>[^4]:  Kahraman Solmaz, Das politische bei Arendt, <a href='https://www.hannaharendt.net/index.php/han/article/download/349/478\#:\~:text=I.,-Das%20Politische%20als\&text=Arendt%20unterscheidet%20zunächst%20die%20Angelegenheiten,2005%2C%2038%2D47).\&text=3%20Die%20Welt%20ist%20nach,2007%2C%2024%20f.).'>https://www.hannaharendt.net/index.php/han/article/download/349/478\#:\~:text=I.,-Das%20Politische%20als\&text=Arendt%20unterscheidet%20zunächst%20die%20Angelegenheiten,2005%2C%2038%2D47).\&text=3%20Die%20Welt%20ist%20nach,2007%2C%2024%20f.).</a><br><br>[^5]:  Karl Marx, Das Kapital, Band 1, Seite 45, http://www.karl-marx.name/pdf/karl-marx-das-kapital-buch-1.pdf  <br><br>[^6]:  Humanistische Union “Wem gehören die Medien?”, <a href='https://www.humanistische-union.de/publikationen/vorgaenge/192-vorgaenge/publikation/wem-gehoeren-die-medien/'>https://www.humanistische-union.de/publikationen/vorgaenge/192-vorgaenge/publikation/wem-gehoeren-die-medien/</a> <br><br>[^7]:  Man könnte argumentieren, dass die spezialisierten Verlage, die zum Beispiel Bücher für das Medizinstudium verlegen, hier eine Ausnahme bilden.

<h3>Introduction to this Blog</h3><br><br>Hello,<br>If you’re reading this then you’ve either come here deliberately or somehow stumbled upon this page unknowingly. Nonetheless I hope there will be something of interest to be found here. As of writing this introduction to this blog, my aim here is mainly to take my ideas and be able to express them in a clearer but also more meaningful way than I could otherwise. I have no intention of using this purely to strengthen my own views, but rather to expose these thoughts or ideas to the world and see what kind of critiques they may receive. Without this one runs the risk of becoming so entrenched in one’s own views that it leads to nothing but dogmatism and furthermore blind ignorance. I can’t promise a consistent schedule for my posts, unfortunately some things take considerably longer to write than others, but I do plan to try and keep this semi-regular. As of yet I have no comment function to receive feedback, but I will try and add one. Some posts may vary between German and English, I find some things easier to formulate in German and some things in English, it is usually dependant upon my source material. Unfortunately I am yet to find a reliable translate function for this page so for the time being a plug-in will have to be used. Thank you. <br><br>Posted 27.10.2025<br><br>
